 * This class represents an observable object.

 * may be any object that implements interface {@link Observer}. After an
 * observable instance changes, an application calling the
 * {@link Observable#notify(Message)} method
 * causes all of its observers to be notified of the change by a call
 * to their {@link Observer#update(Message)} method.

 * The order in which notifications will be delivered is unspecified.
 * The default implementation provided in the Observable class will
 * notify Observers in the order in which they registered interest.

 * When an observable object is newly created, its set of observers is
